KSBoingBall
===========

Challenged by Xamarin's Recipe Cook-off (http://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-recipe-cook-off/)
I wrote this little demo app for iOS 7 which covers the following topics:

 * SpriteKit in general.
 * Creating a UIViewController and adding an SKScene to it.
 * Implement interaction with the scene by standard UIControls and device shaking.
 * Demonstrate how to use the physics engine of SpriteKit to make a ball bounce realistically.
 * Show how to create SKSpriteNodes from a CGContext.
 * Show how to load an animated SKSpriteNode from individual textures.
 * Demonstrate loading and using particle systems created with Xcode's particle editor.
 * Show how to implement collision detection using the physics engine.
 * Show how to play sound effects.

You can find a more detailed post about the project on my blog at http://krumelur.me/?p=164.

The recipe's idea is based on the good old Amiga Boing Ball demo from the 1980s.
I found a very good animation of the ball at http://www.amigalog.com/amiga-boing-ball-logo-and-animation/ for downloading to get me started. 

The result looks like this, but you have to see it in action. It is running at constant 60fps on my iPhone 5.

With particle effects enabled:

The project was built using Xamaring.iOS Indie edition 7.0.0.11.
